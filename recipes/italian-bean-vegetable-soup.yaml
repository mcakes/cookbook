steps:
  - Soak beans in cold water with 1 tablespoon salt for at least 12 hours. Drain and rinse.
  - Cook beans with onion halves, carrot, celery, garlic cloves, rosemary, parsley, and bay leaf in water until tender, about 45 minutes. Discard vegetables and aromatics. Drain beans, reserve cooking liquid and add water to make 2 quarts total.
  - Heat pancetta and olive oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Cook until pancetta softens but doesn't brown. Add chopped onion, carrot, celery, and minced rosemary. Season with salt and cook until softened, 10-15 minutes.
  - Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and cook until moisture evaporates and mixture starts to fry.
  - Add bean cooking liquid, beans, and Parmesan rind. Simmer for at least 10 minutes.
  - Add pasta, zucchini, summer squash, and green beans. Simmer until pasta and vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.
  - Add spinach and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Discard Parmesan rind.
  - Serve immediately or simmer longer for heartier texture. Season with herbs, salt, and pepper before serving.
